## Mutable State: One Dictionary

The entire system has ONE mutable state per engine instance:

```python
self.cost_history = {}  # {symbol: (offset, cost_basis)}
```

**Properties**:
- Bounded: max 4 symbols (SOL, ETH, BTC, BONK)
- Deterministic: updates via pure function output
- Atomic: single Python assignment operation
- In-memory: lost on restart (trade-off for simplicity)

---

## Pure Functions: The Core

All mathematical/logical calculations are pure:

| Function | File | Lines | Property |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| `calculate_offset_and_cost()` | `calculators/offset.py` | 11-91 | Weighted avg cost |
| `calculate_zone()` | `calculators/zone.py` | 9-38 | Zone mapping |
| `calculate_close_size()` | `calculators/order.py` | 8-19 | Position sizing |
| `calculate_limit_price()` | `calculators/order.py` | 22-39 | Price calculation |
| `_calculate_ideal_hedges()` | `core/prepare.py` | 125-159 | Hedge merging |
| `decide_actions()` | `core/decide.py` | 48-119 | Decision engine |
| `_decide_symbol_actions_v2()` | `core/decide.py` | 154-329 | Decision tree |

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Pipeline Pattern** (prepare → decide → execute → report)
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - One-way data flow
   - Each step independently testable

2. **Command Pattern** (TradingAction dataclass)
   - Actions described before execution
   - Verifiable before side effects
   - Audit trail support

3. **Strategy Pattern** (Pool calculators)
   - Pluggable pool implementations
   - Easy to add new pools
   - Decoupled from engine

4. **Adapter Pattern** (Exchange interface)
   - Multiple exchange support
   - Easy testing with mock
   - Decoupled from specific exchange

5. **Lazy Initialization** (Market cache)
   - Load once on first use
   - Immutable after initialization
   - Acts like constants

---

## Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Cost History Lost on Restart
**Severity**: Medium
**Solution**: Add optional persistence

### Issue 2: Single-Process Only
**Severity**: Low
**Solution**: Add state sync layer if needed

### Issue 3: Exchange Order Cache
**Severity**: Low
**Current**: Already mitigated (fresh query each cycle)

## Key Takeaways

### What This Codebase Does Well
✅ Pure functional core (all calculations are pure)
✅ Deterministic decision logic (same input → same output)
✅ Clear pipeline architecture (easy to understand and modify)
✅ Minimal scoped state (cost_history only)
✅ Excellent test coverage (420+ lines)
✅ Immutable configuration (Pydantic BaseSettings)
✅ One-way data flow (no circular dependencies)
✅ Good separation of concerns (each step has single responsibility)

### Trade-offs Made
⚠️ Cost history not persisted (simplicity over crash recovery)
⚠️ Single-process only (by design, acceptable for use case)
⚠️ No distributed state (acceptable for monitoring use case)

### Recommendation
**For**: Single-threaded async hedge monitoring with periodic restarts
**Not for**: Multi-process distributed systems
